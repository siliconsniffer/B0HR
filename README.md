My attempt on creating a threeJS website explaining Bohr's atomic modell.
Created as a school project in April 2023, this is inconsistantly getting updates and polishes.

### Setup

Run:
```npm install```
to install dependencies.

And then:
```npx vite```
to start.

You can then open the displayed address to open it in your webbrowser.
